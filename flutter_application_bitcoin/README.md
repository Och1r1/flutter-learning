This is “The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart” Boss Level Challenge 3. I finally finished all of the boss level challenges and I feel proud of how far I have come. Huge thanks to Angela Yu for creating such a great course that genuinely taught me so many things throughout the modules.

For this project, I had to use a different API provider because the one suggested in the course no longer offers a free demo. After searching around, I found CoinGecko, which worked perfectly for my needs. Big shout out to CoinGecko for their free demo version that helped me test and complete the application.

With this app, you can track the latest Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin prices in many different currencies such as USD and AUD. Before this project, I used to get confused when working with APIs, but this experience really cleared things up. This challenge was tough, but in a good way, and I genuinely enjoyed it. I feel like from today on, I can start building my own freestyle applications to test and colloborate my knowledge.
